This script contains an image process workflow to stitch overlapping, adjacent map scans to support generating seamless map tiles. The script is currently under development and has been tested with a set of Ordnance Survey maps archived at the National Library of Scotland (NLS) (https://maps.nls.uk/os/index.html).
